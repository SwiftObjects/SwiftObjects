Work in progress, stay tuned.

A **very important** first note:
This is a **demo** and an experiment to see whether and how the WebObjects API
might work in Swift.
Do **not** try this at home, it is not how you write web servers nowadays!
Nor is it optimized, or fast at all, to the contrary.

> Careful: Lots of Java'ism:
> A lot of the code is still very Java'ish. This is a rather stupid 1:1 port,
> of a Java port of an Objective-C code base.
> Contributions and suggestions on how to make things Swift'ier are very 
> welcome!
